# Check My Bad Math

## Description
I wanted to tryout Next.js with React Native, and was searching for projects that would be an app I would download as a consumer. After some thought, I thought I'd give a calculator app a go.

Historically, I am bad at math. Even when I write down the problem, use a calculator and triple check my calculations, the result is not correct. My dream with this project is to create something that would help me get the right result AND see where I went wrong.
